Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Classification Project.
Analyzed my Spotify Usage and History by using several tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Python and Python Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

I've used my own personal spotify data downloaded from Spotify's Privacy Settings, the link is given below. The dataset usually takes about 15 days after requesting to be ready.

This analysis can easily be used on any spotify dataset.
